We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs / suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, recently closed issues to ensure others have not reported similar issue. Please include information as follows:

* Any modifications you have made relevant to the bug

## Contributing via Pull Requests
Before sending us a pull request, please ensure:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *main* branch.
2. You check existing open and recently merged pull requests to ensure others have not addressed similar problem.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work.

Send us a pull request:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.
